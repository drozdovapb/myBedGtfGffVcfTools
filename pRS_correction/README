#pRS corrector

Full plasmid correction is a three-step process (but you can use only the second part if you prefer to make annotations yourself). 
1. collect annotations from the old plasmid: 
python3 ./gb_annot_collector.py new_maps/pRS426.gb old_maps/p426GPD-SCH9YFP.gb >collected_features.txt

u can use both a new version of the plasmid you need
If the system says 'cannot overwrite the existing file' but you do wanna overwrite the exsting file, replace > to >|. 


2. Correct plasmid sequence
python3./gb_pRS_corrector.py old_maps/p426GPD-SCH9YFP.gb pRS_diff.txt 
				Initial length:  9770
				found the old version of pRS416_f1_ori
				found the old version of pRS425_old_ending
				found the old version of pRS426_arch_URA3_side
				found the old version of pRS416_ori
				Final length:  9762
				Written the result to corrected_maps/p426GPD-SCH9YFP.gb
Looks good...

3. Annotate the new sequence
python3 ./gb_annotator.py corrected_maps/p426GPD-SCH9YFP.gb collected_features.txt corrected_maps/p426GPD-SCH9YFP_upd.gb 
			['MCS'] not found, trying complementary
			['MCS'] not found <= quite logical... :)
			found ['CYC1 terminator']
			found ['2u ori'] <= good!
			found ['URA3'] <= great!
			found ['SCH9'] <= good! 
			found ['SCH9-YFP'] <= great!
			found ['EYFP'] <= great!
			['T7_P'] not found, trying complementary
			found ['T7_P'] in reverse complementary <= true!
			found ['GAP promoter'] <= good!
			['T3_P'] not found, trying complementary 
			found ['T3_P'] in reverse complementary <= true!
			found ['AmpR'] <= true!
